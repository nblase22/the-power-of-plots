# The Power of Plots

Took on two separate data challenges using Matplotlib.

# Pyber:

A bubble plot showing the following variables from the dataset:

Average Fare ($) Per City

Total Number of Rides Per City

Total Number of Drivers Per City

City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Created 3 Pie Charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type

% of Total Rides by City Type

% of Total Drivers by City Type

# Pymaceuticals:

Analyzed a medical treatment dataset to do the following:

Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.

Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.

Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)

Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
